# Hi, I'm Aakash Madhav Rao 👋

🎓 **Education**  
I'm pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Birmingham. I previously graduated *Magna Cum Laude* from Ashoka University with a Post-graduate Diploma in Computer Science, where I also earned a Bronze Medal for academic excellence.

🧑‍🔬 **Research and Work Experience**  
With extensive experience in applied machine learning and computer vision, my research spans across healthcare, neuroethology, and animal behaviour. I have contributed to groundbreaking projects such as:

- **Neuroethology Lab, Ashoka University**: Developed a high-precision model to track animal movement, achieving 98.29% mAP.
- **Cancer Research**: Designed improvements to PathLDM, a state-of-the-art Latent Diffusion Model for synthetic cancer pathology images, reducing GPU memory usage and improving FID scores.
- **Oral Cancer Studies**: Created OrCHID, the first Indian-origin dataset for oral cancer classification, and presented findings at international conferences.

📜 **Publications**  
I've authored and co-authored multiple manuscripts and papers, including studies on machine learning applications in histopathology and neuroethology, currently under review in prominent journals like *Scientific Data*.

👨‍🏫 **Teaching and Mentoring**  
As a Teaching Assistant, I’ve helped students in courses like *Design and Analysis of Algorithms* and *Introduction to Machine Learning*. I also led research teams, guiding undergraduates in machine learning applications in healthcare.

🏆 **Awards and Honors**  
- **Global Masters Scholarship** (University of Birmingham)  
- **Singapore International Pre-graduate Award** (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research, Singapore)  
- **Dean’s List** & **Magna Cum Laude** (Ashoka University)  

🔧 **Technical Skills**  
Proficient in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and statistical analysis techniques. My expertise covers both the theoretical and applied aspects of AI, from deep learning to high-performance computing.
