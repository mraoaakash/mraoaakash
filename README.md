I am a Research Assistant with the Department of Computer Science and the Centre for Healthcare Analytics and Research Trends (CHART) at the Trivedi School of Biosciences, at Ashoka University. I completed my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with Honors from Ashoka and am currently enrolled in a year long post-graduate diploma in advanced studies and research, where I am working on a thesis as well as numerous research projects. 

My work, as seen under projects, is currently being supported by the [Mphasis Foundation](https://www.mphasis.com/home.html), the International Foundation for Research & Education ([IFRE](http://ifre.org.in/)), the Indian Science and Engineering Research Board ([SERB](https://www.serbonline.in/SERB/HomePage)), and the Indian Council for Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.gov.in/)).My primary area of research is the application of Machine Learning in Biomedical Image analysis, primarily pathology imaging. I however, like to dabble in general deep learning as my interests are primarily on the computational aspects.
